## 8. DETAILED FINDINGS

### ‚úÖ STRENGTHS (What's Working Well)
1. **End-to-End Pipeline**: Fully functional 4-stage orchestration (Collect ‚Üí Enrich ‚Üí Classify ‚Üí Save)
2. **Multiple Data Sources**: Three scrapers + SerpAPI for redundancy
3. **GIS Integration**: Real Newton GIS API queries for parcel data, zoning, geocoding
4. **AI Classification**: GPT-4 powered, uses keyword detection + metric evaluation
5. **Structured Output**: Both CSV and JSON formats for different use cases
6. **CLI Flexibility**: Customizable queries, locations, scoring thresholds
7. **Automation Ready**: Cron job setup documented
8. **Development Score**: Multi-factor scoring (LLM + age + lot ratio + price/sqft + lot size)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è GAPS & LIMITATIONS
1. **MLS Feed**: Not integrated (requires subscription/API key)
2. **CRM Integration**: No Zoho/HubSpot integration
3. **Google Sheets**: No automatic upload capability
4. **Persistent Logging**: Logs currently console-only; should persist to file
5. **DOM Tracking**: Days on market trend not tracked over time
6. **Price History**: No price change tracking across runs
7. **FAR Extraction**: Zoning FAR maximums not extracted from GIS
8. **Email/Slack Alerts**: No notification integrations
9. **Map Visualization**: No geospatial map output
10. **Historical Analysis**: Cannot track trends over time

### üî¥ KNOWN ISSUES
1. **GIS API Rate Limiting**: Newton GIS endpoints sometimes unavailable ‚Üí graceful degradation in place
2. **Newton Assessor API**: Similar rate limit issues
3. **Scraper Blocking**: Zillow has anti-bot measures ‚Üí relying on SerpAPI is safer
4. **Duplicate Listings**: Limited deduplication beyond address matching
